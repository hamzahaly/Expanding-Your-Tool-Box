## Createjs and EaselJs

CreateJs is a suite of modular libraries and tools which  work together or independently to enable rich interactive content on open web technologies via HTML5.

CreateJs includes EaselJs, which I used to create my simple game. It also includes TweenJs, SoundJs, PreloadJs, and Zoe. 

By including the CDN for CreateJs, you can easily access the Javascript Libraries to any of the aforementioned libraries above. EaselJs provides easy to learn solutions for working with rich graphics and interactivity with HTML5 Canvas. The API is familiar to Flash devs, but utilizes Javascript. It has a full, hierarchical display list, a core interaction model, and helper classes to make working with Canvas easy. (paraphrased from EaselJs).

CreateJs has a very active community, with the latest update released in May 2015. 
## An example
I've created a simple game that utilizes EaselJs's library. It takes advantage of using bitmaps and Easel's stage to easily create a simple game in the browser.
