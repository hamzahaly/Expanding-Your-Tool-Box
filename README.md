## Createjs and EaselJs

[CreateJs](http://www.createjs.com/) is a suite of modular libraries and tools which  work together or independently to enable rich interactive content on open web technologies via HTML5.

CreateJs includes EaselJs, which I used to create my simple game. It also includes TweenJs, SoundJs, PreloadJs, and Zoe. 

By including the CDN for CreateJs, you can easily access the Javascript Libraries to any of the aforementioned libraries above. EaselJs provides easy to learn solutions for working with rich graphics and interactivity with HTML5 Canvas. The API is familiar to Flash devs, but utilizes Javascript. It has a full, hierarchical display list, a core interaction model, and helper classes to make working with Canvas easy. (Paraphrased from [EaselJs](http://www.createjs.com/easeljs)).

CreateJs has a very active community, with the latest update released in May 2015. Many web based browser games have been created using CreateJs and EaselJs including a tower defense type game called [Pirates Love Daisies](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2011/07/21/html5-gaming-animating-sprites-in-canvas-with-easeljs.aspx). EaselJs has a [public repo](https://github.com/CreateJS/EaselJS) where there are 71 issues and the last commit was done 9 days ago (Nov. 15, 2015).  

## An example
I've created a simple game that utilizes EaselJs's library. It takes advantage of using bitmaps and Easel's stage to easily create a simple game in the browser. It demonstrates the ease of use of CreateJs and EaselJs's library to create a game.

## Running my example
You can run my example game by simply visiting my [student web server](http://students.washington.edu/hamzaha/info343/Expanding-Your-Tool-Box/). Control the cat by pressing the "A" and "D" buttons to move left and right respectively. Catch the yarn balls and avoid the vacuum cleaner!
